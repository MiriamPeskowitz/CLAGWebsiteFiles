            Code like a Girl is unlike any other book out there. It's a brand new way into learning about tech and code. It's especially written for everyone who has ever thought you have to first be a math genius before writing a single line of code. Because: nah. Code is all about story and language. Pick up a copy at your local indie book store, or  <a class="no-link-background" href="https://www.amazon.com/Code-Like-Girl-Projects-Practical/dp/1524713899"  target="_blank">Amazon</a>, <a class="no-link-background" href="https://www.target.com/p/code-like-a-girl-rad-tech-projects-and-practical-tips-by-miriam-peskowitz-hardcover/-/A-77096390" target="blank">Target</a>, and wherever books are sold.

            In addition to coding at Trinket.io and at scratch.mit.edu, the book guides readers in putting together their own computer from a Raspberry Pi core. That's when the fun begins: with motion sensors, light shows and more. You can just read along, but if you want to dive in, I've put some ideas together for where to get the stuff. Get ready to hop over to Code Like a Girl's Github page.

            No one codes alone. Here are some of the people and companies who support the movement for equality in coding and tech. They're pushing to give everyone a chance to build awesome things with code. I'm happy to include them here. 

            Thanks everyone! You're the best.
